# Python Statements and Loops

## The for loop

In this exercise, we will focus on the usage of the **for** loop, including:
 - `input()` from the user,
 - `range()` function, 
 - `in` keyword. 
## 

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 1 - multiplication table

Your task is to write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
Number is prompted by the user.  
Print results.

- Some of your results could look like this:


```bash
Input a number: 6

Results of multiplication by  6:

6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12
6 x 3 = 18
6 x 4 = 24
6 x 5 = 30
6 x 6 = 36
6 x 7 = 42
6 x 8 = 48
6 x 9 = 54
6 x 10 = 60
 ``` 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 2 - pattern with loop

Your task is to write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a **for** loop.
>Note: Don't type numbers manually. Use the loop!

- Your results should look like this:


```bash
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
88888888
999999999
 ``` 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 3 - reverse word

Your task is to write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it, using a **for** loop.  
>Hint: the `range()` function accepts negative numbers!

- Your results should look like this:


```bash
Input a word to reverse: hello
Reversed word: olleh
 ``` 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 4 - upper letters

Your task is to write a Python program using **for** loop, that iterates over given string and changes every occurence of 'o' letter into big letter 'O'.  
>Hint: use one of the string's method!  

>Note: You can use any text, for example from lyrics. My was "Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?" :smiley:

- Your results should look like this:


```
 HellO, I lOve yOu, wOn't yOu tell me yOur name?
 ``` 

 ### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 5 - count digits and letters

Your task is to write a Python program using **for** loop, that counts digits and letters.  
User should be prompted to enter her/his characters with the keyboard, even without looking at it.  
Store the information about number of digits and letters in some variables.

>Hint: use one of the string's method and try to type only letters and digits!  


- Your results could look like this:


```
Input your characters: dgbudf8gsdf7g8sd7fg7dsf7g7y7df7ygsdfg775uybgfbfdug8fdsugdfsguf7g7df7g7ydf7yg7rye7gy7eryg
Number of digits:  21
Number of letters:  67 
```
